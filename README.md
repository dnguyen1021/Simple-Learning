# Simple-Learning
Implementing a simple machine learning algorithm to predict house prices based on historical data in C.

•	Implemented a program to read the training data matrix and computed the inverse of a matrix using Gauss-Jordan Elimination to learn the weights for each of the attributes.

•	Applied the weighted matrix to new data matrix to predict new prices.
